  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p>The Australian National Botanic Gardens is 40 hectares in
  size being located in the nation's capital of Canberra the garden was designed
  to be of scientific purpose and not just ornamental purpose <cite>(Australian
      National Botanic Gardens, 2018)</cite>. The gardens contain
  approximately 74,000 individual plants and the collection features more than
  6,200 species of plants that comprise approximately one third of Australia's native
  plants making the gardens the largest scientific collection of Australian
  native plants originating from wild plant sources.<cite>(Australian National Botanic Gardens, 2018)</cite></p>
  
  
  <h2>Content and context</h2>
  
  <p>At present the Australian National Botanic Gardens engages
  visitors digitally mostly through a website. The website has many useful
  features such as the ability to search for plants located in the gardens with
  the plants location being shown on an illustrated map. Another useful feature of
  the existing website is the feature that provides the visitor the ability to
  search and browse a catalogue of images of plants. Unfortunately the website
  has not been designed to adapt to be used from mobile devices and is not
  responsive. This doesn't allow visitors to navigate the gardens while accessing
  information about plants from their mobile device. Visit the current map at <a href="https://www.anbg.gov.au/gardens/living/ANBG_section_map/index.html?sectionToHighlight">https://www.anbg.gov.au/gardens/living/ANBG_section_map/index.html?sectionToHighlight</a></p>

  <h2>Existing design solutions</h2>
  
  <p>An example of a mobile friendly approach to providing
  visitors information to navigate the gardens is the free iPhone application 'ANBG
  Birds' produced by the Director of National Parks. This application catalogues
  the resident and migratory birds that inhabit the Australian National Botanic
  Gardens providing the visitors the ability to journey through a range of
  habitats the birds appear in. The application displays for 60 birds images of
  the birds, sounds of the bird calls and descriptions of the bird species. The
  application includes information about walks visitors can take to find the
  specific birds in the gardens. The application also has a feature to create itineraries
  to help visitors make the most of their trip to the Gardens.<cite>(Apple, 2018)</cite></p>

  <p>The Royal Botanic Garden Sydney iPhone application has the
  most modern existing design solution related to the proposed mobile web application
  for the Australian National Botanic Gardens. The application features
  self-guided walking tours containing audio using an augmented reality (AR)
  overlay to enrich the visitor experience. The application also contains
  information about the history of the Royal Botanic Garden Sydney, a feature to
  assist visitors to discover restaurants, amenities and landmarks within the
  garden, information about current events and exhibitions located in the garden
  and Apple Watch integration to provide real-time wayfinding and navigation to
  visitors.<cite>(Apple, 2018)</cite></p>

  <p>Another iPhone application that is a companion to the Royal
  Botanic Garden Sydney iPhone application is The Australian PlantBank
  iPhone application. This application is targeted at providing information about
  the PlantBank's seed vault research into helping to
  restore threatened habitats, conserve wild plant diversity, and provide for a
  healthy and sustainable future. Visitors can see the living laboratory of garden
  beds and the endangered Cumberland Plain Woodland to learn about the research
  in real life.<cite>(Apple, 2018)</cite></p>

  <p>One of the best researched mobile applications for a state
  operated garden was completed by the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens. During October
  2010 Kew Gardens commissioned an in-depth study of their visitors' motivations
  and information needs when visiting the garden's 300-acre site. The express aim
  of the study was that the finding should guide the development of new mobile
  applications. Upon completion of the study it was found that most Kew Gardens visitors
  had social, emotional, and spiritual, rather than intellectual, motivations
  during their time at the gardens. They did not visit the gardens to find out
  more and they did not want or need to know their precise location at all times.
  It was discovered that the visitors loved the sense of unguided exploration and
  the serendipitous discoveries they made at Kew Gardens. A term was coined that
  captured the emotional sense that most visitors enjoyed while visiting the
  gardens, the visitors wanted to become 'delightfully lost.'<cite>(Museumsandtheweb.com,2018)</cite></p>

  <p>Based on this research an iPhone application was created and
  further research on its effectiveness was conducted with visitors who used the
  design. The understanding of audience motivations informed the development of
  the Kew Gardens application using the term of 'delightfully lost' to guide the
  application's design and development to conform to that purpose. The application
  would not provide a structured route opting to aim to provide suggestions of items
  to explore thereby taking visitors in new directions and away from habitual
  routes.'A key focus of the design was to
  avoid visitors being wedded to the phone visually. The application was designed
  to be a tool used in the periphery of the garden experience. The visitor would
  use the application throughout the journey around the garden moving the application
  to the centre of their focus and back to the periphery as little or often as
  the visitor desired. To facilitate a serendipitous discovery experience of the
  Gardens the application included the following features.
  A map with GPS location detection technology
  for orientation and user customization options allowing the visitor's interests
  to be saved to the map. An augmented reality overlay designed to encourage visitor
  discoveries via exploration of the gardens the augmented reality would also
  display the location of trees. A QR code reader allows visitors to scan plants
  and link to in-app content with detailed text and audio visual information
  about the plant being scanned. A photo sharing feature using the Flickr social
  media website that allows social image sharing via uploads by Kew Gardens staff and visitors designed to encourage visitors
  away from their habitual visitation patterns. Finally an image gallery of
  images grouped in themes with the themes designed to encourage visitors to walk
  around the gardens.<cite>(Electronic Workshops in Computing (eWiC), 2018)</cite></p>

  <h2>Insights from existing design solutions</h2>
  
  <p>A key insight to be
  taken from the existing design solutions is that based on the Kew Gardens
  research visitors to the Australian National Botanic Gardens will also likely
  want the application we create to allow them to be 'delightfully lost'.<cite>(Museumsandtheweb.com,
      2018)</cite> This means the application
      is designed to assist and inspire visitors to explore the gardens.</p>
  
  <p>Another important insight
  comes once again from the Kew Gardens application although this time it relates
  to a survey conducted on the errors that users of the application experienced.
  It was found that a large number of visitors who used the application
  experienced technical difficulties associated with the download procedure for
  application updates. The update procedure gave the visitors the latest
  recommendations which are driven by seasonal changes in landscape. The problem
  specifically was that when visitors moved away from arrival gates and into the
  garden the garden provided WiFi could not transmit to
  their phones and the updates then needed to rely on the phones data 3G signal. If
  the users did not have the 3G enabled they would receive the latest updates.<cite>(Museumsandtheweb.com, 2018)</cite></p>

  <h2>Design proposal</h2>
  
  <p>The proposed design is a mobile web application that seeks
  to provide visitors to the gardens a navigation tool that extends existing
  scientific knowledge published by the gardens into the real world while
  visitors explore the gardens. In order
  to incorporate the lessons from existing research the application's features will
  be an interactive map, a plant identification feature that displays information
  about the plant being viewed, social media integration for visitor photo
  sharing and a list of routes that updates based on the seasonal state of the
  gardens. The application will aim to use the existing information on the existing
  Australian National Botanic Gardens website such as the image database of the
  plants. External detailed descriptions of the plants can be attained from the
  Plant Breeders Rights database and Wikipedia.</p>

  </section>  
  
  <h2>Technical specifications</h2>
  
  <p>The interactive map
  will use the Geolocation API to locate the visitor's location in the gardens
  and display the location on a map.</p>
  
  <p>The plant
  identification feature will use the phone video camera to sample images of the
  plant and in real world information to identify the plant in the phone camera
  view port via the MediaStream API's.</p>
  
  <p>The MediaStream API's will be used to take and access the visitors
  photo's allowing the visitor to upload the photo's to social media when they have
  an internet connection.</p>
  
  <p>The list of routes
  will be transferred to the phone via a JSON file, most likely using the GeoJSON format to display the routes. To avoid the update
  errors experience by other applications this application will take advantage of
  the Service Worker API and specifically the background sync feature to update
  the route around the garden in the background even while the visitor is not on
  the url of the application.</p>
  
  <p>The data storage
  will be achieved by using the Service Worker API and localStorage
  API allowing the visitors to access information about plants whether they are
  connected to the internet at the time of using the application or not.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  
  <p>In summary the Australian
  National Botanic Gardens Mobile Web Application uses research an inspiration of
  existing applications that attempt to solve similar problems with modern web
  API's to provide visitors a mobile tool of exploration to be used in the
  gardens providing valuable information whether they are connected to the internet
  at the time or not.</p>
